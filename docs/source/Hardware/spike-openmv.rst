SPIKE-OPENMV overview and pinout
================================
This board is built for SPIKE Prime and Robot Inventor hubs. 

SPIKE-OPENMV overview
---------------------

This board follows the pinout of an OpenMV camera, but it can be used with a Huskylens too.
To get 5V you need to force the LEGO hub to supply 8V on the M+ lead (100% motor power).
Use it with :doc:`PUPRemote <../Software/PUPRemote/docs/index>` on SPIKE3 and Pybricks.
Use it with :doc:`SerialTalk </Software/SerialTalk/docs/index>` on SPIKE2 and Robot Inventor.
