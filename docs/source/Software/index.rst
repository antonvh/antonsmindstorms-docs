MPY Robot Tools
===============

This is a collection of classes and methods that help you to animate
robots. They are specifically aimed at LEGO MINDSTORMS and SPIKE Prime
robots, although the classes are abstract enough to be useful elsewhere.
The functionality is documented inside the code. Here are just the main
usages. For in-depth articles see my blog on
`antonsmindstorms.com <https://antonsmindstorms.com>`__.
